[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI just passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, and I want to share my journey with you. If you\u0026rsquo;re considering taking this exam, hopefully my experience will help you prepare better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-failed-first-attempt-sort-of\"\u003eThe Failed First Attempt (Sort Of)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a year ago, I tried watching Stephane Maarek\u0026rsquo;s AWS Cloud Practitioner course on Udemy. It felt overwhelming. The concepts weren\u0026rsquo;t clicking, and I ended up abandoning it halfway through. Looking back, I now understand why - I was missing the foundational knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-changed-building-core-knowledge-first\"\u003eWhat Changed: Building Core Knowledge First\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game-changer for me was taking INFO1112 at university. This course covered the fundamentals of virtual machines, containers, and cloud computing. Once I understood these core concepts, everything started making sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy advice:\u003c/strong\u003e If you\u0026rsquo;re struggling with AWS concepts, don\u0026rsquo;t force it. Step back and learn the basics first:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat is a virtual machine?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow do containers work?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat problems does cloud computing solve?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have this foundation, the AWS services will feel much more intuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-study-timeline\"\u003eMy Study Timeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"week-1-stephane-maareks-udemy-course\"\u003eWeek 1: Stephane Maarek\u0026rsquo;s Udemy Course\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my new foundational knowledge, I went back to Stephane Maarek\u0026rsquo;s course. This time, it clicked. I completed the entire course in one week. His explanations are clear, and the course structure is well-organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-reality-check-mock-exams\"\u003eThe Reality Check: Mock Exams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing the course, I tried the mock exams. They felt difficult. I started second-guessing myself - maybe I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"confirming-my-knowledge\"\u003eConfirming My Knowledge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to watch the freeCodeCamp AWS Cloud Practitioner course on YouTube. Not because I needed to learn everything again, but to confirm my understanding and fill any gaps. This helped me realize I actually knew more than I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"final-preparation\"\u003eFinal Preparation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched some mock exam question videos on YouTube and started doing well. That\u0026rsquo;s when I knew I was ready. I booked my exam for 2 days later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"exam-day\"\u003eExam Day\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went in feeling confident.
