I just passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, and I want to share my journey with you. If you're considering taking this exam, hopefully my experience will help you prepare better.

## The Failed First Attempt (Sort Of)

About a year ago, I tried watching Stephane Maarek's AWS Cloud Practitioner course on Udemy. It felt overwhelming. The concepts weren't clicking, and I ended up abandoning it halfway through. Looking back, I now understand why - I was missing the foundational knowledge.

## What Changed: Building Core Knowledge First

The game-changer for me was taking INFO1112 at university. This course covered the fundamentals of virtual machines, containers, and cloud computing. Once I understood these core concepts, everything started making sense.

**My advice:** If you're struggling with AWS concepts, don't force it. Step back and learn the basics first:
- What is a virtual machine?
- How do containers work?
- What problems does cloud computing solve?

Once you have this foundation, the AWS services will feel much more intuitive.

## My Study Timeline

### Week 1: Stephane Maarek's Udemy Course

With my new foundational knowledge, I went back to Stephane Maarek's course. This time, it clicked. I completed the entire course in one week. His explanations are clear, and the course structure is well-organized.

### The Reality Check: Mock Exams

After finishing the course, I tried the mock exams. They felt difficult. I started second-guessing myself - maybe I wasn't ready?

### Confirming My Knowledge

I decided to watch the freeCodeCamp AWS Cloud Practitioner course on YouTube. Not because I needed to learn everything again, but to confirm my understanding and fill any gaps. This helped me realize I actually knew more than I thought.

### Final Preparation

I watched some mock exam question videos on YouTube and started doing well. That's when I knew I was ready. I booked my exam for 2 days later.

## Exam Day

I went in feeling confident. The exam itself was:
- Not too hard
- Not too easy
- Very manageable with proper preparation

I finished with about 40 minutes to spare. I reviewed all my answers, then submitted about 20 minutes early.

When I saw that **PASS** on the screen, the relief was incredible.

## My Advice to You

**Don't overcomplicate it.**

I see so many people asking "Am I ready?" or "Should I study for another month?" Here's the truth - this is a beginner-level exam. Many people who have passed will tell you the same thing, and after taking it myself, I completely agree.

Here's what I recommend:

1. **Build your foundation first** - Understand basic cloud concepts before diving into AWS-specific content
2. **Pick one good course** - Stephane Maarek or freeCodeCamp, both are excellent
3. **Don't over-prepare** - If you're scoring well on practice tests, book the exam
4. **Book it sooner rather than later** - Having a deadline keeps you focused

## What's Next?

I've already started preparing for the AWS AI Practitioner exam. Hoping to take it next week. I'll share my experience once I pass that one too!
